The Railway Reservation System is an advanced platform designed to simplify the train booking process by allowing passengers to check train availability based on their specified source and destination. This system efficiently manages a comprehensive database that stores records of various trains, their statuses, and passenger details, automating the entire reservation process to ensure accuracy, security, and reliability.

Online reservation has revolutionized seat booking, offering users unmatched convenience. The system keeps track of bookings efficiently, enabling users to focus on other tasks. Administrators have the capability to input new train details, view and modify existing train records, and remove outdated entries, ensuring that the database remains up-to-date. 

Each train record includes vital information such as the train's name, number, departure and arrival stations, schedule, available seats, and fare. By streamlining the reservation process, this system enhances user experience and contributes to a more organized and efficient railway management system.
